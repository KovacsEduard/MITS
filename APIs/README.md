# APIs — static site pages

This folder contains the required static pages for the MITS project:

- `index.html` — Home
- `product.html` — Product / API listing
- `pricing.html` — Pricing table
- `team.html` — Team and values
- `styles.css` — Shared stylesheet

Open any of the `.html` files in a browser or serve the folder with a simple static server (for example `npx serve` or `python -m http.server`) to test responsiveness and accessibility.

Notes:
- All pages follow basic WCAG-friendly structure (semantic HTML, skip link, focus styles).
- Use the `assets/` folder for images and icons; some placeholder image paths point to `../assets/images/` which you can replace with real assets.
